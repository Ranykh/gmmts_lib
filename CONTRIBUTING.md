    to learn how to setup the development environment.
2. Find an issue to work on. Look for issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/kathyrazNVDA/GMMTS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
    or [help wanted](https://github.com/kathyrazNVDA/GMMTS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
3. Comment on the issue saying you are going to work on it.
4. Code! Make sure to update or add tests where applicable.
5. When done, [create your pull request](https://github.com/kathyrazNVDA/GMMTS/compare).
6. Verify that CI passes all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/), or fix if needed.
7. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed.
8. Once reviewed and approved, a maintainer will merge your pull request.

Remember, if you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarifications!
